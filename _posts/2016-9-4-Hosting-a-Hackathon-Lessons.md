I replied to a a question up on [/r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions) a few days ago: what are good
things to keep in mind when hosting a hackathon?

I'm on the team that hosts LA Hacks at UCLA. It's on the larger side of hackathons, sponsoring 36 hours of hacking with
easily a thousand people involved. My role was organizing transportation for hackers throughout California, but I also sat in on
nearly every meeting leading up to the event. 

We learned a lot hosting the event - things we hope to keep in mind next year. I won't get into the nitty gritty of how to 
contact partners and whatnot, but there are a few higher-level concepts that I think are critical to understand when trying to make
something like a hackathon the best it can be.

***
1. It might be obvious, but money is important. We all have ideas for making a hackathon great, but we didn't (and I'm guessing that you don't) have infinite funds. Like a lot of hackathons, we raised money through corporate sponsors. However your funds are coming in, start early, go hard, and don't let up. You'll never have too much money.



2. On the subject of money, balance carefully. There are bells and whistles you can get that sound cool, but aren't realistic. Make sure you cover all your basic needs FIRST, and then grab whatever is left. In our case, that meant cutting back on things like transportation reimbursements and swagbag goodies to ensure we had enough food and drinks, proper wifi in the venue, proper power, security, etc. Don't cut necessities short.



3. Hackers might not care about what you think they care about. Try your best to figure out what is really important to your attendees. One example that comes to mind is food - we cut our food budget nearly in half from the previous year, saving tens of thousands of dollars by buying some admittedly lower quality meals. Were we afraid of a little backlash? Sure. Did we get any? None. I'm not saying feed your hackers garbage, but it seemed like they were happy campers regardless of whether the meal was worth $5 or $15, so long as their stomachs were full.



4. On the opposite end, there are small things that you can do that hackers will care about. Something as small as purchasing a roll of 'whiteboard' paper and laying out some dry erase markers on every table got us some appreciation. Toothbrushes, toothpaste, cups, and floss in the bathrooms are cheap, but important - speaking as both an organizer and a hacker.



5. Figure out why you're hosting your hackathon. Like I said above, we got all of our funding from corporate sponsors. Obviously, that comes with its own set of demands - they give you money to get something out of you. We made it a point to not lose sight of the fact that we were hosting the hackathon for hackers, not our sponsors. We tried our best to give our sponsors their demands, but we drew many, many lines where we thought we might be harming our hacker experience. Obviously, our goal might not be the same as yours, but I say this because I believe it's paramount to keep your intentions in the front of your mind.



6. I mentioned it in the last point, but the experience you put together for hackers is important. This involves a lot of things, but our team placed emphasis on making sure people understood where to go if they need help or feel unsafe, making a point of being welcoming to brand new coders, and overall making sure everyone was having a good time. You don't want to have a reputation as 'that shitty hackathon', ever.



7. Have fun! What you're doing is awesome, and you shouldn't forget that.

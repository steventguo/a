Part two of my thoughts on hosting hackathons!  
<br>

The last time [I talked about hackathons](http://www.cluelesscode.com/personal/2016/09/04/Hosting-a-Hackathon-Lessons.html), I discussed what I thought we did well - things our team should keep doing to keep LA Hacks successful. We didn't do everything right, though, and there's one specific item that really nags at me. It's definitely something I'll be sure to keep in the front of my mind for next year.

I think we should have put more emphasis on helping the beginners. There are a lot of people completely new to coding, and 'hackathon' is a scary term. They ask themselves, "should I apply and attend?", but speaking from a hackathon organizer's perspective, the answer is always yes. Those who make the plunge, apply, and come are already a small, select group. Realistically, it's hard for them to have fun. Who would have fun feeling 'useless' and leaving the weekend with nothing to show for it? I replied to another poster in this thread who had this exact same concern.  
<br>


It really doesn't take a lot for someone experienced to help out. When I started out, I had questions like 'how should I share this code with my team?', or 'how can I set this dev environment up?', or 'what's a server, and how do I put my website up on one'? These are questions that a mentor can spend 5 minutes answering, and all of a sudden you have a team of beginners with a working canvas to paint on for the entire weekend. Leave them hanging, and you have a team of beginners going home feeling stupid and empty-handed after banging their heads into a wall the entire event. It makes a huge difference. Even providing a few workshops allows them to go home saying, "I didn't make anything, but at least I learned a lot."  
<br>


I've found that for most hackers, making fun is not your job. You're there to provide a safe, hospitable environment. Give an experienced hacker that, and they'll make fun on their own - they came to your event on their own accord, after all, and knew what they were getting into.  
<br>


The people who (probably) can't make their own fun are the first-timers, who often don't know how to code. Give them mentors, check in on them, provide tutorials and workshops for them, make sure they're leaving with something.  
<br>


Outside of that, I'd recommend providing some activities outside of hacking. We had a preview screening of a show, some gaming lounges (courtesy of our sponsors), and some panels with various speakers and groups. It's a hackathon, but nobody can hack for hours on end. Give them something to do during their downtime.  
<br>


It might seem like an insignificant problem, but I think it's an area that we definitely need to work on. We should be doing everything we can to encourage creativity and imagination, and one part of that is coaxing out the passion within a brand new hacker.
